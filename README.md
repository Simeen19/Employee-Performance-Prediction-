# **Employee Promotion & Attrition Prediction System** 


## **1. Collecting the Data**  
The first step is to gather a dataset related to employee performance and attrition. A good source for this is Kaggle, which provides HR datasets containing information about employees, their job roles, salaries, performance ratings, and whether they have left the company.  


## **2. Cleaning & Preparing the Data**  
Once we have the dataset, the next step is to clean it up and get it ready for analysis. This involves:  
- Removing unnecessary columns like `EmployeeCount`, `Over18`, and `EmployeeNumber`.  
- Handling missing values by either filling them in or removing rows with too much missing data.  
- Converting categorical data (like department names) into numerical form using one-hot encoding.  
- Dealing with outliers, for example, capping extremely high salary values that might skew the results.  

The cleaned-up dataset is then saved for further analysis.  


## **3. Building Machine Learning Models**  
With the data ready, we move on to building machine learning models to predict two things:  
1. **Attrition (Employee Leaving the Company)**  
   - A classification model (Random Forest Classifier) is trained to predict whether an employee is likely to leave.  
   - We evaluate how well the model works using a classification report and a confusion matrix.  

2. **Performance Rating Prediction**  
   - A regression model (Random Forest Regressor) is used to predict an employee’s performance rating.  
   - We check how accurate it is using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and the R² score.  

Python libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib help in training and testing these models.  


## **4. Analyzing Results & Drawing Insights**  
Once the models are trained, we analyze their results to make better HR decisions:  
- **Attrition Prediction:** Identify employees at risk of leaving and take action to retain them.  
- **Performance Ratings:** Use predicted performance scores to determine who deserves a raise or promotion.  
- **Feature Importance:** Find out which factors (salary, job satisfaction, workload, etc.) play the biggest role in these predictions.  

Visualizing these insights with graphs and charts makes them easier to understand.  


## **5. Using the Results for HR Decisions**  
Based on the model’s predictions, we can make smarter HR decisions:  
- **Salary hikes and promotions** should go to employees with consistently good performance.  
- **Retention strategies** can be designed for employees flagged as likely to leave.  
- **Further improvements** can be made by testing more advanced models like XGBoost or fine-tuning the existing ones.
